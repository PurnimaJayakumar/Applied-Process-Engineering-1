# Applied-Process-Engineering-(APE)-1
Detailed process flow, material balance and energy balance data for 50 tonne/day ammonia production. (2025-26)

Inspired by problem statement of AIChE 2019 "Modular Distributed Ammonia Synthesis"

Development is ongoing in APE-2 with fluid mechanics and heat transfer considerations in the plant.
